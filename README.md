# Make lisam a bit more bearable

We all know Lisam is horrible software, a lot of it can't be changed but a big problem,
at least on smaller screen is the amount of screen real estate taken up by static uncationable or pointless things.
For example, there is a like button on the exam registration page...

### After

## Installation

First, install a browser extension that supports userstyles, [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) is a good choice.

Then, open the [raw version of the not-so-shit-lisam.user.css](https://github.com/TheZoq2/not-so-shit-lisam/raw/master/not-so-shit-lisam.user.css).
Finally click "install style" and enjoy being slightly less annoyed at the stupidity
that is Lisam.
